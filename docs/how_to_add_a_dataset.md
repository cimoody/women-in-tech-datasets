#How To Add a Dataset

1. Confirm it meets the [inclusion requirements](dataset_inclusion_criteria.md).
2. Create a folder for it under /women-in-tech-datasets/datasets.
3. Create the OVERVIEW.md file for the dataset, place it in the dataset folder you just created.
4. Add a snapshot copy of the dataset to the folder as well.
5. Update the /datasets/dataset_list.md file to link to the OVERVIEW.md document you made.
6. Commit your changes and submit a pull request against the repo.
