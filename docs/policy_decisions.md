#Policy Decisions

### What is your definition of woman?

For this project a woman is any individual who self-identifies as a woman. The overall philosophy is to be as trans-affirmative as possible. 

### What about genderqueer and non-binary people?

This project will afford genderqueer and non-binary people every respect and welcomes conversations about ways to be more respectful and inclusive of gender minorities. Since genderqueer and non-binary people do not self-identify as women, they are not the focus of this project. However, gender in tech obviously *is* the focus of this project and this project hopes to be able to help genderqueer and non-binary people as well. At this time no datasets that affirmatively account for genderqueer and non-binary people are known. If you know of one, please let us know!

### What is your definition of technology?

This project will utilize a broad definition of technology. "Tools that have an on switch" is the current working definition. However, this project also admits to being started and focused on software developers (i.e. code writers) given its founder's background.
